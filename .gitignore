# This .gitignore is designed to ONLY track:
#   /wp-content/plugins/
#   /wp-content/themes/
#
# It ignores all WordPress core files and other content.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Ignore all files and directories in the root
/*

# 2. But, DO NOT ignore the .gitignore file itself
!/.gitignore

# 3. And DO NOT ignore the wp-content directory (so Git can see inside it)
!/wp-content/

# 4. Now, ignore everything INSIDE wp-content...
/wp-content/*

# 5. ...EXCEPT for the plugins and themes directories.
# This tells Git to track these folders and ALL files/folders inside them.
!/wp-content/plugins/
!/wp-content/themes/

!/.github

/wp-content/plugins/gibbs-react-booking/node_modules
/wp-content/plugins/gibbs-react-booking/node_modules/*


# 6. (Optional) Ignore common system files or backups
#    that might end up inside your themes/plugins folders.
